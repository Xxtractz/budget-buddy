## Design Direction

The design should feel modern, trustworthy, and financially sophisticated - like a premium banking app that's approachable rather than intimidating, with clean lines and purposeful use of color to communicate financial status clearly.

## Color Selection

Complementary (opposite colors) - Using green for positive financial actions and red-orange for spending/warnings to leverage universal financial color associations.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Green (oklch(0.45 0.15 150)) - Communicates growth, stability, and positive financial health
- **Secondary Colors**: 
  - Neutral Gray (oklch(0.85 0.02 0)) - For backgrounds and supporting text
  - Soft Blue (oklch(0.65 0.12 240)) - For informational elements and secondary actions
- **Accent Color**: Warm Orange (oklch(0.65 0.18 45)) - For warnings, spending alerts, and important CTAs
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (White oklch(1 0 0)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.2 0.02 0)) - Ratio 15.8:1 ✓
